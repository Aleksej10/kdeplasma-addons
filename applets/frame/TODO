TODO FOR 4.1:

- clean the code: class Picture is added (28th January 2008), still to do is add slideshow code there
- comic-like engine. 
- engine to support many Pictures of The Day 
- Make the Wikipedia Picture Of The Day an engine (RSS) - Keep craig Duquette updated when it's done so he'll see about a flickr engine! - have several engines as the comic engine has.
- clean the config dialog and take ideas from Desktop config (share some config settings?) - add recursive dirs as an option for slideshow (although beware of too many options)


IDEAS FOR THE FRAME APPLET
(some already implemented)

- export the pic to Flickr
- display the album cover if the user is playing some music
- from leinir: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/135/328898823_ae9eb3dfd6_m.jpg 
The images sort of scale down and fade in when the appear... then after thirty or so pictures are shown, the lower ones fade out again :)
- meta data: flip the pic and read metadata (date, size,...) and add your own comment
