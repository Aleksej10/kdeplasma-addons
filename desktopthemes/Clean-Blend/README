The idea of this theme to to be clean and match with the default colour scheme
of KDE4.x and Plasma themes can be any colour you wish and are not doomed to be
black.

I have done other colour schemes for this theme, Steel and Obsidian Coast to try
and cover the milder colours and dark colours.

Hope you enjoy this theme and any comments or suggestions you can see me at irc.freenode.net #plasma
