Just a quick overview about the goals of this thing:

This little project will provide the user the ability to layout his applets
in a more advanced way. He will be able to group them inside special
QGraphicsWidgets called Groups, in a way that depends on the specific group.
So, e.g. there is a grid group that layouts the applets in a grid, a
floating group that leaves them free to move inside the group and others to
come. I want to develop a desktop containment and a panel one. The panel
isn't yet started.
The applets are added to a group dropping them from the "add applet" thing
or moving them over the group. If it is necessary (like in the grid group) a
drop zone will be shown (like in the panel).

 =====================================================================

More technical stuff:
This is composed of a library and two containments.
The library consists of a base class for the containments,
GroupingContainment, and a base class for the groups, AbstractGroup plus
internal class(es) like GroupHandle.
This classes provide all the things needed to write a simple, basic group or
a simple, basic containment with grouping support and they co-operate well
together. So, e.g. the floating group has only few lines of code, most of
which are the copyright header and constructor and destructor, as the
desktop containment, while the grid group that is more specialised is more
"fat".
In order to be able to have many types of groups with their different needs
when speaking of saving the configuration, i moved this from the containment
to the groups: AbstractGroup has two pure virtual methods,
saveAppletLayoutInfo(Plasma::Applet, KConfigGroup) and
restoreAppletLayoutInfo(Plasma::Applet, KConfigGroup) which its subclasses
must reimplement, which actually save and restore the configuration. This
way it isn't the containment that saves, but it delegates this to the
specific groups that know how the applets are arranged and so know the best
way to save the configuration. The grid group saves "Row" and "Column", a
tab group would save a "Index" and so on. That way in the config section of
every applet inside a group there will be a [GroupInformation] group with some
keys, one of which is mandatory (Group=id of the group), while others will
depend on the type of the group.
The configuration of the groups are instead saved in [Containments][Id][Groups][Id].

There are two groups right now, a grid group and a floating group, and one
desktop containment.
Other groups will come, I think, like a tab group, a stack group,... like a
panel containment.

TODO: (with more or less a decreasing priority)
-finish the movings of the applets inside the grid group;
-hard bug and crash hunting;
-develop the panel containment;
-create a nice interface to add groups;
-decide if make the groups pluginnable;
-add support for configurations of the groups;
-group in group support;
