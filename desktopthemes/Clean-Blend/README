The idea of this theme to be clean and blend with the default colour scheme
of KDE4.x, filling a gap with the dark themes. You can find other colour schemes
for this theme, Steel and Obsidian Coast to try
and cover the milder colours and dark colours, you will find them in
trunk/playground/base/plasma/desktoptheme/
