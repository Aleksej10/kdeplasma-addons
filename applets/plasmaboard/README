KNOWN ISSUES

- KEYBOARD DOES NOT WORK
Since KDE 4.2.2 plasmaboard does not work anymore on most distributions. The problem is caused by a change in the plasma library. 
To fix that I needed to commit a patch to KDE. Sadly it didn't make into the 4.2.4 release. I hope some package maintainers will integrate the patch.
Plasmaboard works with KDE 4.3 RC1.

- When pressing "Alt Gr" the symbols on the keyboard do not adapt. This is an issue with the underlying X-Function, which seems
only to do mapping for the shift key correctly. No known solution yet. Despite of that AltGr works as expected 

- When changing the xkb-modmap, plasmaboard does not adapt automatically. You need to force the relabeling of the keys. Press "Shift" for example

- Backspace key does not work in eclipse. Don't know why. If you find other applications in which plasmaboard doesn't work as expected, please report

- Caps lock does not work for some keys. Don't know why. Shift works.
