Todo:

* Limitations:
  - Add a "configure" button to the screensaver if the location isn't set 
    (maybe not feasible at the moment?)
  - The dataengine for the first location doesn't seem to go away after
    setting a new location, so changing the location won't work unless you
    change to another plugin and change back or restart plasma-desktop
    (This works in plasmawallpaperviewer though...)


* Features:
  - Add an element of time in determining the wallpaper, so that night pics can
    come at night, etc. (The weather icon we receive can't provide this for most 
    weathers)
  - Show basic weather info/location name on top left of screen
    + Autodetect metric/imperial measurement systems based on locale, or at least
      let the user choose between the two
  - Allow the user to set a custom wallpaper for weather conditions.
    + Use m_weatherMap to store wallpaper/weather assignments
    + Implement advanced settings dialog to house the feature
